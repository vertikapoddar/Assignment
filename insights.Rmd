**ANOMALY**

Prima-facie the following anomalies have been observed from the frequency bar chart:

1. There are couple of instances where the number of vists made to a location as per the credit card do not match with the loyalty card data. This indicates missing data in the two datasets.

2. There are 55 credit cards whereas the number of loyalty cards is 54. The credit card with no corresponding loyalty card will be identified in later part of the investigation.
